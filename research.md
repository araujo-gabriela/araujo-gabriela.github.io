We develop a general equilibrium banking model in which liquidity, credit and solvency
risks are endogenously connected to banks’ lending decisions. In this framework,
monetary policy is transmitted to the economy because it affects the link between bank
risks and credit provision. The model provides a unified explanation for several empirical
facts documented in the literature. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating
endogenous risk interactions into the analysis of monetary transmission through the
banking sector.
