#### Endogenous Bank Risks and the Lending Channel of Monetary Policy 
with [David Rivero](https://sites.google.com/site/davidriveroleiva/home) and [Hugo Rodriguez Mendizabal](https://sites.google.com/barcelonagse.eu/hugorodriguezmendizabal/home) 

We develop a general equilibrium banking model in which liquidity, credit and solvency
risks are endogenously connected to banks’ lending decisions. In this framework,
monetary policy is transmitted to the economy because it affects the link between bank
risks and credit provision. The model provides a unified explanation for several empirical
facts documented in the literature. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating
endogenous risk interactions into the analysis of monetary transmission through the
banking sector.

#### Migration, Culture, and Long-Run Development: Evidence from Brazil’s German Colonies
This paper examines the long-term impact of early settlers on economic prosperity.
Specifically, this paper investigates the long-term economic impact of 19th-century
German immigration to southern Brazil, focusing on how early human capital
shocks shaped development in a largely undeveloped region. Exploiting spatial
variation in proximity to historical German settlements, I find that municipalities
closer to these colonies exhibit significantly higher current literacy rates and
income levels. The empirical strategy combines a quasi-natural experiment with
robustness checks, placebo tests, and a comparative analysis with Italian settlement
areas to support causal interpretation. I show that literacy is a key mediating
channel, and that historical proximity to German colonies is associated with
structural shifts away from agriculture and toward human capital-intensive industries.
These findings highlight the enduring influence of early skilled immigration on
local development.
